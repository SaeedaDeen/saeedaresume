    <body>
        <p> I have been an expemplary student from my childhood, easily inspired, diligent, hard working and hungry for knowledge </p>
        <p> The following is an up-to date list of all my education and qualifications </p>

            <dl>
            <dt><h3> Ordinary Level (2011-2013) </h3></dt>
            <dd> I did my Cambridge IGCSE O/Ls in the following subjects; Accounting(A), Economics(A), Commerce(A), Maths(A), IT(A), Islamiyat(B), English(A), English Literature(B)</dd>
            
            <dt> <h3>Advanced Level (2013-2015) </h3></dt>
            <dd> For my Cambridge IGCSE A/Ls, I did the subjects; Accounting(b), Economics(C), Business Studies(B), English Literature(C)</dd>
            
            <dt><h3>ATCL Diploma in Speech and Drama</h3></dt>
            <dd>I had been persuing Trinity College education in speech and drama from foundation (from 2003) right up to grade 6 therefore, it only made sense for me to complete my diploma in the subject. The ATCL diploma is the Trinity College London's equivalent in standard to the first year recital of an undergraduate degree. Associate Performance Diplomas are a one-unit qualification assessed by performance only. I qualified this diploma with a Distinction. </dd>
            <dd>Key Skills taken from this includes 
                <ul>Communication</ul> 
                <ul>Confidence</ul> 
                <ul>Listening and responding</ul> 
                <ul>Creativity</ul> 
                <ul>Critical thinking and problem-solving</ul> 
                <ul>Time management</ul>  
                <ul>Research.</ul> </dd>

            <dt><h3>BA Fashion Design & Marketing (Hons)</h3></dt>
            <dd>At this point in my life, it was evident to me that I was a creative person and I was excited to persue higher education in a creative field. I joined this Fashion design and marketing degree affiliated with University of Northumbria in Newcastle. Through this degree, I developed technical knowledge in areas of; 
                <ul>research and concept development</ul> 
                <ul>design development</ul> 
                <ul>graphic design</ul> 
                <ul>fashion design</ul> 
                <ul>photography</ul> 
                <ul>styling</ul> 
                <ul>editorial design</ul> 
                <ul>and marketing theory</ul></dd>
            <dd>Most importantly, I developed a love for graphic design and spent many hours learning the ins and outs of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Much like my current fascination with learning HTML and web design, in this period of my life, I was completey amazed by the wonders of creating digital art and illustrations</dd>  
            
            <dt><h3>Diploma in Jewellery Design</h3></dt>
            <dd>I come from a family of jewellers and have had a passion for jewellery all my life. I took up this diploma at the Academy of Design in Sri Lanka and upon it's completion I launched my own line of jewellery</dd>

            <dt><h3>MA Advertising- (Current)</h3></dt>
            <dd>I am enjoying learning about creative direction, advertising management and engaging with extra-curriculars such as the Graduate Skills + programme. </dd>
            <dd> My current research project is based on the “Good Life 2030” initiative by the  Purpose Distruptors and I am focusing on immigration and it’s impact on quality of life in the UK.</dd>
